[compression]
-------------

Specify various compression settings, such as compression utility,
compression level, etc.

**method** = gzip| gzip-rsyncable | pigz | bzip2 | pbzip2 | lzop | lzma | gpg | zstd

    Define which compression method to use. Note that some methods may 
    not be available by default on every system and may need to be compiled
    or installed.

    For gpg compression, a key should already exist(``gpg --gen-key``)
    and ``default-recipient`` must be configured in ``~/.gnupg/gpg.conf``.
    
**inline** = yes | no

    Whether or not to pipe the output of the backup command into the compression
    utility. Enabling this is recommended since it usually only marginally
    impacts performance, particularly when using a lower compression
    level.
    
**level** = 0-9

    Specify the compression ratio. The lower the number, the lower the 
    compression ratio, but the faster the backup will take. Generally,
    setting the lever to 1 or 2 results in favorable compression of 
    textual data and is noticeably faster than the higher levels.
    Setting the level to 0 effectively disables compression.
    
**bin-path** = <full path to utility>

    This only needs to be defined if the compression utility is not in the
    usual places or not in the system path.

**split** = yes | no

    Defautls to no. If set the backup will be piped through the split command.
    This may be useful for user's with large databases, as some backup systems perform
    better with many smaller files instead of 1 large one. This defaults to 1GB file size,
    so this option isn't helpful if your dumps are smaller than that.
