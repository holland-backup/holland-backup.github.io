Usage and Implementation Overview
=================================

Because Holland is very pluggable, it may first seem a bit confusing when
it comes to configuring Holland to do something useful. Out of the box,
Holland is designed to backup MySQL databases using the mysqldump provider.
This is the simplest setup, and may be sufficient for most people. However, 
others may wish to have more fine-grained control over their backups and/or 
use another method other than mysqldump.

For instance, one can configure a backup set to backup certain databases
using mysqldump, others using the mysql-lvm plugins etc. All this is done
by a mix of providers and backup-sets.

Backup-Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^

Each backup-set implements exactly one provider and will inherit the default
values of that provider. These values can be overridden to adjust the
behavior of the backup set. This includes defining what databases or tables
to include (or exclude) in the backup, the type of compression used (if 
any), what locking method to use, among other things.

Providers
^^^^^^^^^

Providers essentially provide a backup service for use in a backup set. 

* mysqldump

    Uses the ``mysqldump`` utility to backup databases.

* MySQL + LVM

    Backup MySQL databases using LVM snapshots which allows for near lockless 
    or fully lockless (when transactional engines are used) backups.

* mysqldump + LVM

    This plugin creates an LVM snapshot, starts a mysql instance using the snapshot
    as it's datadir, and then use the ``mysqldump`` utility to backup the databases.

* XtraBackup

    .. versionadded:: 1.0.8
    
    Backup MySQL databases using Percona's 
    `XtraBackup <http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtrabackup>`_ tool.
    This provides a near lockless backup when using the InnoDB storage engine.

* pgdump

    Backup PostgreSQL databases using the ``pgdump`` utility.

* mariabackup

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0
    
    Backup MySQL databases using MariaDB's 
    `mariabackup <https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/mariabackup-options/>`_ tool.

* mongodump

    .. versionadded:: 1.1.0

    This plugin performs logical backups of a MongoDB by using the ``mongodump`` utility.

* Example

    This is used solely as a template for designing providers. It otherwise
    does nothing.
    
As Holland is a framework, it can actually backup most anything as long
as there is a provider for it. This includes things that have nothing to do 
with databases. The idea is to present an easy to use and clear method
of backing up and restoring backups no matter the source.
